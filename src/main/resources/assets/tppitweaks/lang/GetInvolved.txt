To get involved in TPPI's development, feel free to stop by reddit.com/r/testpackpleaseignore for general pack discussion.~
~
To talk to the dev team directly via IRC, visit #TestPackPleaseIgnore on irc.esper.net.~
~~~
The reddit is the place to go to discuss pack features and provide feedback, etc, but NOT report bugs.~
~
All bug reports should instead be submitted as issues on the TestPackPleaseIgnore repository, located at github.com/TPPI-Dev.
~~~
If you want to help out with TPPI Tweaks and/or the in-game mod documentation project, 
check out the TPPI-Tweaks github repository.~
~
The "SupportedMods.txt" file in our assets folder will let you add documentation.

Make sure you follow the formatting guidelines outlined at the top of the file when documenting mods, and good luck!~
